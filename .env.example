# CartaRep Lighting Consultancy - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values

# ====================================
# Backend Configuration (if deployed separately)
# ====================================

# API endpoint for production (if backend is hosted separately from Netlify)
# Example: https://api.cartarep.com or https://cartarep-backend.herokuapp.com
# Leave empty if using Netlify Functions for backend
VITE_API_URL=

# ====================================
# Database Configuration (Required for backend)
# ====================================

# PostgreSQL connection string
# Required for backend operations
# Example: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL=

# ====================================
# Email Service Configuration (Required for contact forms)
# ====================================

# SendGrid API key for sending emails
# Required for contact form and catalog request functionality
# Get your API key from: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
SENDGRID_API_KEY=

# ====================================
# Server Configuration (Optional)
# ====================================

# Port for the server (defaults to 5000)
# Usually not needed for Netlify deployment
PORT=5000

# Node environment (automatically set by Netlify)
# NODE_ENV=production

# ====================================
# Frontend Environment Variables
# ====================================

# Any frontend environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# Example:
# VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
# VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=

# ====================================
# Netlify-specific Variables (Set in Netlify Dashboard)
# ====================================

# These are typically set in the Netlify dashboard:
# - NODE_VERSION (set to 20 in netlify.toml)
# - GENERATE_SOURCEMAP (set to false in netlify.toml for smaller builds)

# ====================================
# Notes for Deployment:
# ====================================

# 1. Frontend-only deployment (Netlify):
#    - Only VITE_* variables are needed
#    - Set VITE_API_URL to your backend API endpoint
#    - Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
#      Site settings > Environment variables

# 2. Full-stack deployment:
#    - DATABASE_URL is required for database connection
#    - SENDGRID_API_KEY is required for email functionality
#    - Backend must be deployed separately (Heroku, Railway, etc.)

# 3. Important:
#    - Never commit .env files to version control
#    - Keep sensitive keys secure
#    - Use different keys for development and production
#    - Rotate keys regularly for security
